Energy-derivative attention module-enhanced UNet for semantic segmentation
Engineering structural damage often exhibits diverse and complex features across multiple scales within a small-scale region of interest (ROI), complicating accurate extraction for post-earthquake recovery assessments. In this study, a deep learning-based interpretable framework is developed to perform semantic segmentation of diverse damages in post-earthquake structures. Specifically, an energy-derivative attention module is integrated into the convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to enhance its ability to precisely extract small-scale ROI features in multicategory damage scenarios. A geometric consistency focal-informed (GCF) loss function is further designed to enhance focus on the regions and boundaries of small-scale ROI, incorporating geometric constraints such as split line length, curvature, and area. To address feature imbalance and reduce bias during model training, mosaic data augmentation is applied during dataset preparation to enhance the representation of characteristic features in small-scale ROI. As a result, the proposed method demonstrates superior accuracy in the semantic segmentation of multiple damages (spalling, crushing, exposure, and buckling) after a well-training procedure, outperforming the baseline with an mIoU increase from 80.67% to 88.87%. The maximum IoU for concrete spalling damage reaches up to 89.16%, while the minimum IoU for steel bar buckling improves to 82.96%. The synergy of geometric consistency, energy derivative attention, and mosaic augmentation is validated in enhancing CNN performance for the semantic segmentation of four damage categories. Finally, three functional modules for damage classification, quantification, and evaluation are integrated into graphical user interface software to enable accurate post-earthquake assessment of engineering structures.
